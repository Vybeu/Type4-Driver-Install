# Type4-Driver-Install
This is created to automate the install of Type4 Sharp and HP drivers in a production environment.

Type4 Drivers require the use of 'Admin' credentials to be installed and as such, this script should be run with admin credentials. 

This was written with the use of Datto RMM in mind, so files are able to uploaded during the creation of the component. You can adapt this script to your needs by replacing the Path for the file to copy.
